/**
 * One headline word inside an overflow mask, so it can rise into view.
 * The mask is padded on every side (and pulled back with matching negative
 * margins, so layout is unchanged) because glyphs that overhang their advance
 * box (italic and display letters, descenders) would otherwise be clipped.
 *
 * It clips with clip-path rather than overflow: an inline-block with overflow
 * hidden takes its bottom edge as its baseline, so words with and without
 * descenders sat on different lines. Clipped this way each word keeps its own
 * text baseline and the whole heading sits on one.
 *
 * `attr` names the data attribute the animation targets: the hero uses
 * data-reveal="word" (hidden before first paint), section headings use
 * data-heading-word (animated on scroll).
