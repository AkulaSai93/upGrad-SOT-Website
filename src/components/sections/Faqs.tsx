/**
 * "Frequently Asked Questions"
 *
 * Copy is sot.upgrad.com's, verbatim: the heading and line (less its lead-in), the five common
 * questions with their answers, and the link to the full list (allFAQs).
 *
 * Layout, kept clean: the centred heading, then the questions as a single
 * column of white rows with 6px corners and a thin border — the number in red,
 * the question, and a plus that turns into a cross while open. One answer
 * shows at a time (the first to start). Under them a quiet link to all FAQs.
 *
 * Motion (GSAP): the answer opens and closes by height while its text fades
 * in; the rows rise in one after another on scroll.
