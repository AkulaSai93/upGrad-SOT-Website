/**
 * "1000+ Students Have Already Attempted uGNET"
 *
 * Copy and photos are sot.upgrad.com's, verbatim: the heading and line, the
 * four students' words (each quote in two parts, as there) with their three
 * takeaways, and the closing "Get started" call and "Apply Now".
 *
 * Layout after a persona carousel the client supplied: the centred heading,
 * then the current student's card in the middle, red with a black border
 * and white type like the scholarship card in Admission (the others white) — their photo beside their
 * name and takeaways, the two parts of their quote beneath under small grey
 * labels — with the previous and next students' cards beside it, the same
 * size, hinged on their inner edges and turned away in 3D, faded.
 * Under it the four photos in a row pick between them (the current one ringed
 * in black). Then the call to action as a full-width band of red fluted
 * glass, as newtonschool.co closes its page: the line on the left, a white Apply Now on
 * the right.
 *
 * Motion (GSAP): the cards swing round the carousel to their places; the
 * students take turns on their own every few seconds (paused while the pointer
 * is on them or the section is off screen); the call to action rises in on
 * scroll. Below md only the current card shows.
