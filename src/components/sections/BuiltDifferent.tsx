/**
 * "How We're Built Different" — reproduced from sot.upgrad.com, built from that
 * section's own class list and computed styles rather than by eye:
 *
 *   section    padding 64px vertical at lg (py-14 / sm:py-16 / lg:py-16).
 *              Rendered light per the site's light-theme brief: the source
 *              panel is black, so surfaces and text are mapped to this
 *              project's light tokens while sizes, spacing and the red
 *              accent stay exactly as measured.
 *   container  shared .container-page gutter, flex-col, gap-10 -> lg:gap-[60px]
 *   header     max-w-[609px], centred; h2 32/36/40px, 600, lh 60px,
 *              "How " white + "We're Built Different" in --primary red
 *   intro      16px / 400 / lh 24px, white, mt-20px
 *   grid       1 -> md:2 -> lg:4 columns (320px each at 1440), hairline
 *              dividers in neutral-800, no card backgrounds
 *   cell       py-8 sm:py-10, contents centred, px-6 sm:px-8 md:px-10
 *   icon       h-20 w-20 -> sm:24 -> md:28 box, image object-contain,
 *              scales to 110% on hover over 300ms
 *   title      16px -> sm:18px, 700, lh 28px, neutral-50, centred, mb-2 sm:mb-3
 *   body       12px -> sm:14px, 400, lh 1.625, neutral-400, centred, max-w-xs
 *   accent bar 4x32px at left, centred vertically, neutral-700, grows to 80px
 *              on hover with a red glow layer fading in
 *
 * Heading and cell type follow the site-wide section style (SectionHeading,
 * bold display titles); the eight cells rise in, staggered, on scroll.
