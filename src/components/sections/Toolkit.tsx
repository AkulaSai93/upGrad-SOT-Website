/**
 * "Your Innovation Toolkit, Included"
 *
 * Copy is sot.upgrad.com's, verbatim: the heading and line.
 *
 * Laptop after the MacBook Pro hero on apple.com (the client's reference),
 * made from our own pieces: a Figma AI render of a midnight MacBook Air — the
 * model students are given — seen from above the keyboard (camera notch,
 * Touch ID, no speaker grilles beside the keys), lid tilted back (AI-upscaled
 * to 3072px; no logo). Its black surround is cut away, so it sits on the
 * section's white or black alike (macbook-air-cut.webp, made from
 * macbook-air-open-hd.webp); the screen is a hole too, and behind it sits
 * the wallpaper (wallpaper-supplied-hd.jpg), warped onto
 * the display's exact four corners with a CSS matrix3d, so it reads as the
 * laptop's screen.
 *
 * RIGHTS TO CLEAR: wallpaper-supplied-hd.jpg is the image the client supplied —
 * Apple's own MacBook Air wallpaper, which is Apple's copyrighted artwork.
 * Confirm upGrad may use it (e.g. through Apple's partner marketing
 * resources) before launch, or swap in an original. The supplied copy was
 * 554x554; this one is AI-upscaled from it to 2216x2216.
 *
 * The section turns black as it comes into view (a timed GSAP fade of its
 * --tk-* colour tokens, as on Pathways and Leaders) and back to white on the
 * way out; the nav turns dark over it.
 *
 * Layout from the client's Figma frame (node 99:10688, after apple.com's
 * MacBook Pro hero): black; the heading 56px from the top; the MacBook
 * centred below it, its lid about 63% of the page wide, cut by the section's
 * foot just below the function row. (The frame carries Apple's own photograph;
 * our MacBook Air render stands in for it.)
 *
 * Motion (GSAP, once, as the section comes into view): the MacBook simply
 * appears — it fades in where it sits as its display lights up and the light
 * pools under it. Nothing moves and the page never holds. Under reduced
 * motion it is shown as it is.
